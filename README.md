# Mangata & Gallo - Homepage Project

This is the final project for the **"HTML and CSS in Depth"** course by Meta.

## About

This project was developed as part of the course's final assessment. The task was to create a homepage for one of four fictional clients, based on their personas and business characteristics. I chose **Mangata & Gallo**, a luxury jewelry brand based in Austin, Texas, specializing in high-quality, elegant designs for engagements, weddings, and anniversaries.

## The Challenge

The exercise required more than simply coding a webpage ‚Äî it involved thoughtful planning and design decisions such as:

- Using semantic HTML tags to structure content logically and accessibly
- Applying CSS for a polished, luxurious visual identity
- Implementing Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout and responsiveness
- Adding hover effects, transitions, and animations for interactivity
- Building a responsive navigation menu with JavaScript

## Development Process

Mangata & Gallo represents sophistication and attention to detail. To reflect that, I designed a homepage that feels elegant and premium. The structure follows a clear content flow:

- A full-width **hero section** with CTA
- A gallery of jewelry **collections**
- A section for **custom designs**
- An **about** section featuring the lead designer
- A detailed **contact** section with form and store info
- A stylish **footer** with links and newsletter signup

### Technologies used:
- HTML5 with semantic elements (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- CSS3 with Flexbox, Grid, and transitions
- Responsive design for multiple screen sizes
- JavaScript for mobile menu toggle
